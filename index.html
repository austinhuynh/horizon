Since breaking through with a series of self-produced singles in 2020—and signing to Capitol Records—the Los Angeles-based artist has earned an adoring global fanbase irresistibly drawn to his guitar-driven alt-pop and confessional yet carefree songwriting. 2022 saw Bissett release his EP, 'I'm Alright If You're Ok', featuring standout tracks “Tripping Over Air”, “All That I'm Craving”, and “Twenty Something” and tour with Claire Rosinkranz, Lauv, and The Greeting Committee.</p>

                                <p class="col-12 artist-content">The Diz is a new four piece band that doesn't hold themselves to any specific genre of music. With original songs that span from funky rock anthems that will get you dancing and grooving, to beautiful ballads that can make you cry, a full set by the Diz is an emotional roller coaster that leaves you wanting more. Friendship runs deep in the band and is always on full display, both in how well the musicians meld with each other, as well as their propensity to get goofy and have fun.</p>

                                <p class="col-12 artist-content">If Isaac Dunbar revealed himself to be a time traveler, it would make perfect sense. The Rhode Island-born and Los Angeles-based singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and producer leaps between Broadway levels of theatrical bombast, skyscraping stadium rock hooks straight out of the seventies, nineties-esque alternative spirit, and larger-than-life two-thousands pop extravagance. There's nothing subtle about him&#8212;and the world is better for it. Isaac's keen emotional intuition and artistic acuity belie his age, and at just 19-years-old he has asserted himself as the rare talent who gleefully defies genres, rules, and eras all at once.</p>
                                <!-- In between opening for girl in red during 2019, he unveiled music at prolific pace. "onion boy" racked up over 19 million Spotify streams, while <i>balloons don't float here</i> instantly reacted with audiences. At 16-years-old, he inked a deal with RCA Records and served up <i>isaac's insects</i> in 2020 and <i>evil twin</i> in 2021. The latter boasted "love, or the lack thereof," amassing north of 14 million Spotify streams. Along the way, <i>VMAN</i> attested <i>"an expert autodidact, Dunbar's impressive knowledge of music theory and diverse tonal range have set the young vocalist apart from cookie-cutter pop."</i> Following acclaim from <i>Time</i>, <i>Billboard</i>, <i>Teen Vogue</i>, <i>Nylon</i>, <i>The FADER</i>, <i>NPR</i>, and more, the Afro-Italian American crash landed as the outlier we need right now with his 2022 EP, <i>Banish The Banshee</i> via RCA Records.</p> -->
                                <!-- <p class="col-12 artist-content">Synth-pop singer Isaac Dunbar began writing music at age nine, using online tutorials to teach himself how to play keys and guitar as well as how to use production software. Apple Music radio host Zane Lowe premiered his breakout track, "Pharmacy," after the romantic trap-pop song created buzz among bloggers when Dunbar posted it online at age 14. On the heels of his 2020 major label debut, <i>isaac's insects, E! Online</i> named him one of 15 Future Pop Stars You Need to Know Now. He collaborated with award-winning pop producer Leland on the track "God, This Feels Good" for the teen dramedy <i>Love, Victor</i>.</p> -->

                                  Do NOT mix drugs and alcohol. There is no way to anticipate how your body will react to the mixture-the reaction could be very serious or even fatal.

                                  Remember: You never know what you are actually taking. Though distributors may assure you that you are getting a certain drug, there is a high likelihood that this drug has been cut with something else, or is a different drug entirely. This is especially common with pills. 
                                </li><br>
                                <li>
                                  If you do choose to engage in drug use:
                                  <ul>
                                    <li>
                                      Test your pills with an affordable drug testing kit, like those sold at <a href="https://dancesafe.org/" target="_blank">dancesafe.org</a>. DISCLAIMER: Drug testing kits do not indicate that a substance is safe. Drug use is never 100% safe. 
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                      Make sure to remain hydrated. A good rule of thumb is to drink about two cups of water (500ml) every hour. Be careful to not consume water too quickly- this can cause an electrolyte imbalance that could become fatal.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                      If you do not feel well, seek help immediately! DO NOT SLEEP IT OFF. The symptoms of drug overdose can be the same, more exaggerated, or totally different than those of excessive alcohol use.
                                    </li>

                                      You WILL NOT be punished for your drug/alcohol use retroactively if you seek help from an official. Your safety is our first priority.

                                    <li>
                                      If they are displaying extreme or out of character behavior, get them help. It could be the result of drugs or excessive alcohol in their system, and their health may be at risk.

                                      Consent is a mutual, affirmative, voluntary, and revocable agreement by each participant to engage in sexual activity. An informed verbal “yes” must accompany positive and engaging body language.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                      The initiator of sexual activity is responsible for receiving consent from their partner. Obtaining consent is a continuous process, meaning consent to kissing doesn't mean consent to everything else. Consent is voluntary and can be withdrawn at any time. Consent must be given without coercion, force, threats or intimidation by the initiator.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                      Consent cannot be given when someone is under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol. However, perpetrators may attempt to use alcohol and/or drugs to facilitate a sexual assault. Statistically, the majority of reported sexual assaults occur while one or both parties are under the influence of alcohol or drugs.  Alcohol or drugs is never an excuse for choosing to violate another person.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                      There are a number of drugs that may be added to beverages with the intent of altering the consciousness or incapacitating a person without their knowledge. Substances are particularly dangerous when combined with alcohol, and often produce amnesia, leaving a victim unclear about what occurred.  These drugs can facilitate criminal activity, most often acts of sexual misconduct or sexual assault.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                      Sexual assault is any unwanted, non-consensual behavior from kissing and fondling to rape. Ignorance of the law or of University policy concerning sexual assault, sexual misconduct and sexual harassment is never an excuse for non-consensual sexual behavior.
                                    </li>

                                  <strong>Preventing Sexual Assault</strong><br>
                                  Keeping UC San Diego safe is a community responsibility. Check out the tips below on how you can help prevent sexual assault:
                                  <ul>
                                    <li>
                                      Identify common behaviors that often precede an assault. Recognizable red flags include seeing someone who is attempting to separate an intoxicated individual from their friends, or continuing to pour drinks for an individual who is clearly beyond their limit.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                      Take action as a responsive bystander and remember to use <a href='https://care.ucsd.edu/programs/ideas.html' target='_blank'>IDEAS</a> if you see those behaviors happening.  You can help someone who is intoxicated by reconnecting them with their friends, or calling a CSO to escort that person home. You can also notify any of the concert volunteers or law enforcement officials on site if you are concerned for someone's safety and well-being.
                                    </li>
                                  </ul>
                                  <strong>Supporting Survivors of Sexual Assault</strong><br>
                                  If something happens to a friend, know you can be a responsive bystander by showing your support:
                                  <ul>
                                    <li>
                                      Listen and believe them. Let them know that you care.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                      Remember sexual assault is never the fault of the survivor.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                      Be aware of your response and respect their decisions.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                      Know the resources and seek support for yourself.
